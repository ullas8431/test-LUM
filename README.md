# LUM Build 

## 📘 Introduction
“The LUM container is a structured archive generated by the BitBake build system. 
It includes all necessary binaries, metadata, and configuration files for flashing a specific hardware unit. 
The build process collects artifacts, runs target parsing, organizes files into a standard layout, and packages everything into a .tgz file.”

## 📁 Directory Structure
ivi_cicd_bitbake_build-main is the main project folder containing everything related to the IVI CI/CD BitBake build system.
[Directory Structure](https://github.com/ullas8431/test-LUM/blob/main/LUM-folder-structure.png)

## 📁 buildsystem/
The heart of the build system. Contains scripts, configurations, and BitBake layers.

### 🔹 bin/
Contains executable scripts or helper tools used during the build process.
### 🔹 build/
Working directory where builds are executed.
conf/: Contains core BitBake config files like:
local.conf: Local build settings.
bblayers.conf: Lists active layers for the build.
### 🔹 build_configs/
Platform-specific build configurations.
COMMON/: Shared settings across all builds.
HCP3/, OIA/: Specific hardware or platform targets.
### 📦 BitBake Layers (meta-eso_*)
Each layer represents a modular part of the build process.

### 🔹 meta-eso_aosp/
Integrates with Android Open Source Project.
conf/: Layer configuration.
recipes/: BitBake recipes for AOSP components.
### 🔹 meta-eso_build/
Core build logic.
classes/: Custom BitBake classes.
conf/: Layer config.
lib/: Python or shell libraries.
recipes/: Build instructions for packages.
### 🔹 meta-eso_finalize/
Final steps in the build process.
conf/, recipes/: Final packaging, cleanup, or post-processing.
### 🔹 meta-eso_image/
Image creation logic.
classes/, conf/, recipes/: Defines how the final image is built.
### 🔹 meta-eso_image-preparation/
Prepares the image (e.g., partitioning, bootloader setup).
conf/, recipes/
### 🔹 meta-eso_install/
Handles installation logic.
classes/, conf/, recipes/
###🔹 meta-eso_packaging/
Manages packaging of build artifacts.
classes/, conf/, recipes/
###🔹 meta-eso_prepare/
Pre-build preparation steps.
conf/, recipes/
###🔹 meta-eso_processing/
Post-build processing or transformation.
conf/, recipes/
### 🐍 pylib/
Contains Python utilities used in the build system.

Common/: Shared Python modules.
misc/: Miscellaneous utilities.
helpers/: Helper functions.
parser/: Parsing logic.
storage/: Data storage or caching logic.
### ⚙️ variant_configs/
Contains configuration files for different build variants (e.g., LUM, IFU).
Each .conf file defines settings for a specific variant.
### 🔧 Tools
cariad-synctool: Likely a tool for syncing code or artifacts with Cariad systems.
synctool: General sync utility.
 

## 🔄 Build Workflow
The build process is defined as a custom BitBake task `pkg_LUM`, which runs after initialization and before the main build.

### Key Steps:
- Copy system images and metadata
- Include bootloader binaries and kernel images
- Add project-specific binaries (e.g., safety-island for OIA)
- Include DSP firmware and exception lists
- Copy partition layout files
- Package Android kernel images
- Integrate manufacturing and UCC tools
- Add signing utilities and autorunner scripts
- Run target parser for IOC configurations
- Create minimal ext4 filesystem for HUD
- Archive all files into a `.tgz` package

## ▶️ How to Run
This task is automatically invoked by BitBake as part of the build sequence. To run it manually:
