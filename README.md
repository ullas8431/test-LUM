# LUM Build Process

## 📘 Introduction
“The LUM container is a structured archive generated by the BitBake build system. 
It includes all necessary binaries, metadata, and configuration files for flashing a specific hardware unit. 
The build process collects artifacts, runs target parsing, organizes files into a standard layout, and packages everything into a .tgz file.”

## 🔄 Build Workflow
The build process is defined as a custom BitBake task `pkg_LUM`, which runs after initialization and before the main build.

### Key Steps:
- Copy system images and metadata
- Include bootloader binaries and kernel images
- Add project-specific binaries (e.g., safety-island for OIA)
- Include DSP firmware and exception lists
- Copy partition layout files
- Package Android kernel images
- Integrate manufacturing and UCC tools
- Add signing utilities and autorunner scripts
- Run target parser for IOC configurations
- Create minimal ext4 filesystem for HUD
- Archive all files into a `.tgz` package

## ▶️ How to Run
This task is automatically invoked by BitBake as part of the build sequence. To run it manually:
