readme_content = """# LUM Build Process

## üìò Introduction
This document outlines the LUM (Linux Unified Module) build process using BitBake. The process packages system images, bootloaders, tools, and configuration files into a final LUM image archive for deployment.

---

## üîÑ Build Workflow
The build process is defined as a custom BitBake task `pkg_LUM`, which runs after initialization and before the main build.

### Key Steps:
- Copy system images and metadata
- Include bootloader binaries and kernel images
- Add project-specific binaries (e.g., safety-island for OIA)
- Include DSP firmware and exception lists
- Copy partition layout files
- Package Android kernel images
- Integrate manufacturing and UCC tools
- Add signing utilities and autorunner scripts
- Run target parser for IOC configurations
- Create minimal ext4 filesystem for HUD
- Archive all files into a `.tgz` package

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
This task is automatically invoked by BitBake as part of the build sequence. To run it manually:
